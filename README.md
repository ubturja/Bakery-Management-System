The Bakery Management System (BMS) is designed to streamline the operations of a small, family-owned bakery by improving efficiency, reducing errors, and enhancing customer satisfaction. The system will cater to four distinct user roles: Manager, Customer, Cashier, and Baker, each with specific functionalities.

Manager Role: The Manager will have system administration capabilities, such as managing user accounts and credentials. They will oversee order management, including viewing and updating order status, and will handle financial management by tracking income, expenses, and profitability. The Manager will also maintain inventory, ensuring products and ingredients are updated in the system. Additionally, they will monitor customer feedback to improve services.

Customer Role: Customers will create, manage, and update personal accounts. They can browse and explore available bakery items, add products to a shopping cart, and track their order status. They will also have the ability to leave reviews and feedback on purchased items, helping improve product offerings and customer satisfaction.

Cashier Role: The Cashier will display available products and manage discounts or promotions for items. They will generate receipts for completed transactions and generate reports to analyze sales performance and product popularity, enabling informed decision-making for the bakeryâ€™s offerings.

Baker Role: Bakers will manage recipes, including creating, updating, and deleting digital recipes for bakery products. They will ensure inventory checks are done, verifying the availability of required ingredients for production. The system will allow bakers to record production details such as quantities, batch numbers, and expiration dates. They will also be responsible for reporting any equipment malfunctions or maintenance needs.

The application will be developed in Java, ensuring smooth compilation and execution. It will include validation mechanisms for user inputs to avoid logical errors and ensure data integrity throughout the system. By integrating these features, the BMS will enhance operational efficiency and provide valuable insights for the bakery.
